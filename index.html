         <h2>My Journey as a Mom</h2>
         <p>Becoming a mother has been the most transformative experience of my life. From the moment I first held my son in my arms, I knew that everything had changed. My journey as a mom has been filled with challenges, joys, and countless learning moments that have shaped who I am today. As the years passed, I learned that my son has special needs. This meant that my responsibilities as a mother increased significantly, leading me to pause my career ten years ago to devote my time to his care..</p>
         <p>During these years, I did everything I could to support and nurture him. Now, he is a smart, thriving kid who is attending school. With him becoming more independent, I feel it's the right time to restart my career. I chose this Launchcode to help me bridge the gap and update my skills.</p>
         <p>I am committed to putting in the effort and learning as much as possible. My goal now is to secure a job as soon as I can and begin this new chapter in my professional life.</p>

            <h2>Falling in Love with Colorado</h2>
            <p>When I moved to the USA and settled down in Florida, everything started to fall into place. Life began to feel more stable, and I was adjusting well to my new surroundings. Florida offered its own unique charm, with its warm climate and beautiful beaches, but there was always a sense that something was missing. That all changed when my family took a trip to Colorado.</p>
            <p>Our trip to Colorado was unforgettable. From the moment we arrived, I was captivated by the stunning landscapes and majestic mountains. The crisp, fresh air and the cool weather were a refreshing change from the Florida heat. We spent our days exploring trails, soaking in the beauty of nature, and capturing countless pictures to remember the experience.</p>
            <p>I found myself daydreaming about what it would be like to live there. If I ever get the chance in the future, I know that I would love to move to Colorado. </p>
